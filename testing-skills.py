def count_unique(input_string):
    """Count unique words in a string.

    This function should take a single string and return a dictionary
    that has all of the distinct words as keys, and the number of times
    that word appears in the string as values.


    For example:

        >>> print_dict(count_unique("each word appears once"))
        {'appears': 1, 'each': 1, 'once': 1, 'word': 1}

    Words that appear more than once should be counted each time:

        >>> print_dict(count_unique("rose is a rose is a rose"))
        {'a': 2, 'is': 2, 'rose': 3}

    It's fine to consider punctuation part of a word (e.g., a comma
    at the end of a word can be counted as part of that word) and
    to consider differently-capitalized words as different:

        >>> print_dict(count_unique("Porcupine see, porcupine do."))
        {'Porcupine': 1, 'do.': 1, 'porcupine': 1, 'see,': 1}

    """
    count_unique_dict = {}
    words_list = input_string.split()

    for word in words_list:
        key = word
        value = words_list.count(word)

        count_unique_dict[key] = value

    return count_unique_dict
